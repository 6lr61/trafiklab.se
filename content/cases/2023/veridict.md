### The History of Network maps

Tracing back to the late 19th century, network and transit maps have served as a vital element in public transportation
and traffic information systems. Characterized by their unique design of multicolored lines, they allow for effortless
navigation and instant understanding of the public transportation system. As a fundamental tool for traffic information,
network maps significantly enhance passenger satisfaction by providing:
- Easy comprehension
- A clear traffic system overview
- Rapid, intuitive display of interchange opportunities, lines, and stations
- A universal and established interface, ensuring accessibility for everyone

### Live network maps – The Future of Traffic Information

Thanks to the advent of dynamic data, the next generation of network maps is here. By adding a layer of real-time
positioning data, an enriched experience is provided to passengers. A cursory glance at the live network map offers
crucial information, such as the next departure, interchange options, and more. This comes in handy especially in
stressful situations, when time is critical, and browsing a journey planner or website might be impractical.

The value of Live network maps is particularly apparent during delays or traffic disruptions. Passengers can instantly
view the positions of incoming trains or buses, even when digital signage fails to provide accurate information. As a
tool for improving traffic information, Live network maps increase customer satisfaction and boost brand awareness for
transport operators using them.

_"We've identified a significant demand for these live maps, and public transport authorities have acknowledged the
tremendous benefits digital maps present, both for passengers as well as reduced cost of maintenance. We are proud to
spioneer this technology and packaging for Live network maps"_, states Alexander Seward, CEO of Veridict.

### You have collected data from Trafiklab since 2015. How do you experience our service?

_“We think it’s very convenient that the data is collected in the same place, and it is often requested from our partners
to use Trafiklab. From our perspective, it is very positive that individual traffic operators are increasing their data
over time”_ says Alexander.

### What do you think about the future for the type of systems you are developing?

_“We see a trend towards simpler and more easy-to-use user interfaces and features, with the passenger in focus. At the
same time, high-quality real-time data will be increasingly important. Based on that, we see that the concept of Live
network maps is very timely.”_
