## A cooperation between Samtrafiken and Trafikverket

Trafiklab was founded in 2011 as a cooperation between Samtrafiken, SL and RISE Viktoria. Today Trafiklab is a way to
fulfill Trafikverkets duty to publish public transport data. This is realized by cooperation between Samtrafiken and
Trafikverket.

At Trafiklab developers can use data and APIs for public transport in Sweden, and easily obtain the information needed
to develop services which benefit Samtrafikens owners, partners, travelers, and society as a whole.

At Trafiklab we drive innovation for open data in the mobility sector, together with different actors both in- and
outside our industry. We continuously work to open more datasets, and to improve the datasets we already provide, in
order to create even more possibilities for developers
