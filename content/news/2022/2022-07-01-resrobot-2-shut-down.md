After a 6 months migration period, we are now shutting down version 2.0 of the Resrobot API. The majority of all users
have made the required changes to their applications, and will therefore not notice a thing. Any applications which have
not yet been updated to v2.1 will need to be updated in order to keep working. 

For more information, please see [our earlier news post regarding these changes](2022-02-07-resrobot-update.md).
