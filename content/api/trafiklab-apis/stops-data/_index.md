The stops data API contains detailed data of Sweden's national stops and their mappings to stops from the [GTFS Regional](/api/trafiklab-apis/gtfs-regional/)
and [Netex Regional](/api/trafiklab-apis/netex-regional/) APIs.

All of Sweden's stops are included in this dataset.

### What does this dataset contain?

This dataset contains all of Sweden's stops in the NeTEx format. There are multiple different KeyValue-elements for each StopPlace and Quay that
contains information that does not fit into any standard Netex elements. Many of these extra KeyValue-elements are mostly useful for operators consuming the data.

### Data format

The data is in the NeTEx (**Ne**twork and **T**imetable **Ex**change) format. This is a format in which all European
operators have to publish their data. The data is aimed at both operator-to-traveller communication and internal
communication between different organizations.

### KeyValues explained

Most of the KeyValues refer to DataSource IDs. These IDs can currently be transformed to actual datasources/authorities through the [NeTEx Sweden API](/api/trafiklab-apis/netex-sweden/)
, by mapping the DataSource IDs to Authority.PrivateCode in the _shared_data.xml file. In the future we are going to provide a better way of matching DataSource IDs to datasources/authorities.  

The Keys that are used for mappings all start with the name "local-" and are pipe symbol separated and then colon symbol separated values.
For example a StopPlace with the Key "local-number" with the Value "7:64204|12:7051|74:40|8:64204|100:4" should be interpreted as list of five different values, 
where each part is further interpreted by separating by the colon symbol, "7:64204" meaning datasource=7 and number=64204. The table below explains more about what 
data each Value contains.

"Gid" matches part of the StopPlace.Id (or Quay.Id) in Netex Regional, and also the stop_id from stops.txt in GTFS Regional.

| owner                         | This value indicates which datasource should be considered the owner of this StopPlace and its Quays.<br/>Often this is the county's public authority in which the StopPlace resides. |
