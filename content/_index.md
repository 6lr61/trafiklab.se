We publish high quality data, make it simpler to access APIs from public transport companies, easier to find data and more interesting to talk about possibilities.

At Trafiklab, we provide official open data for all public transport in Sweden

Public transport data is available as both scheduled and realtime data, and it is continuously updated. We are constantly working with opening up more data sources and improving the existing ones.
