# Occupancy data in GTFS Regional Realtime

In the past month we have started publishing new data in the GTFS Regional Realtime dataset. This new data shows the
occupancy on public transport vehicles in realtime, which adds opportunities and enables use-cases which were not
possible before. This occupancy data is included in the already existing `VehiclePositions.pb` feed, in accordance to
the GTFS Realtime specification.

## For which operators is this data available?

At this moment this data is only available for Sk√•netrafiken. We are continuously working to publish more data for more
operators, but have no timeline for upcoming operators supporting this data.

## When will this data be available?

It will be released in one of the coming days.

If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to contact us at info@trafiklab.se, or to open a support issue at
support.trafiklab.se.

Regards, Team Trafiklab
